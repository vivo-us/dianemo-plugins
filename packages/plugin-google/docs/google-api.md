# Google APIs

Findings behind `@dianemo/plugin-google` — OpenID Connect userinfo, Address
Validation, and the Maps quotas that shape how one client spans several Google
APIs.

**The OAuth model below is common to both Google packages.**
`@dianemo/plugin-google-vertex-ai` is built on the same service-account flow and
cites the two sections that follow rather than restating them — see
[`plugin-google-vertex-ai/docs/vertex-ai-api.md`](../../plugin-google-vertex-ai/docs/vertex-ai-api.md).

## No grant bootstraps from a client id and secret

Google's discovery document lists exactly four grant types:

```
authorization_code
refresh_token
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
```

<https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>

There is no `client_credentials`, so a client built on that grant gets
`unsupported_grant_type` from the token endpoint and can never authenticate at
all. None of the four it _does_ offer bootstraps from a `clientId`/`clientSecret`
pair on its own either:

| grant                | what it additionally needs                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `authorization_code` | a user at a browser                                  |
| `refresh_token`      | a token already stored from a previous grant         |
| `device_code`        | a user at a browser                                  |
| `jwt-bearer`         | a service-account assertion, re-signed every refresh |

**Consequence for a plugin.** A Google client-level `refreshConfig` has nothing
it can be given that will mint a first token — except the jwt-bearer assertion,
which needs a hook that runs per refresh (see below). `plugin-google` therefore
declares a client-level config that deliberately omits the `refresh_token` it
cannot obtain, so a grant-less call fails at Google with `invalid_request` naming
the missing field, rather than shipping the literal `{{refreshToken}}` as a
credential. `plugin-google-vertex-ai` goes the other way and signs an assertion.

`{{refreshToken}}` itself only ever resolves on a _grant_ config; that is core's
behaviour, not Google's — see
[`/docs/core-behaviour.md`](../../../docs/core-behaviour.md#refreshtoken-cannot-bootstrap-a-client-level-refresh).

## Service-account (JWT-bearer) flow

The service account is the credential this flow rests on, and
`plugin-google-vertex-ai` is the package that ships it.
`serviceAccountEmail` is the `client_email` from the service-account JSON key and
`privateKey` its `private_key`. The IAM roles the engine needs are in
[that package's doc](../../plugin-google-vertex-ai/docs/vertex-ai-api.md#authentication).

The assertion is an RS256 JWT, header/claim set/algorithm exactly as Google
documents them: `{"alg":"RS256","typ":"JWT"}` over `iss` (the service-account
email), `scope`, `aud` (the token URL), `iat` and `exp`, signed SHA256withRSA,
then posted to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` as
`grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&assertion=<jwt>`.

<https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account>

Three things about it are not visible from the code:

- **`exp` has a documented maximum.** It "has a maximum of 1 hour after the
  issued time", and Google rejects an `exp` more than 65 minutes past `iat`. So
  `ASSERTION_TTL_SECONDS = 3600` is a ceiling, not a tunable — raising it makes
  every refresh fail.
- **Private keys usually arrive with escaped newlines.** Lifted out of the JSON
  key by hand, or passed through an env var, `private_key` comes through as
  `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n…`. `crypto.createSign().sign()` rejects that as
  a malformed PEM, so it is unescaped before signing.
- **It is signed with `node:crypto`, not a JWT library.** Rejected
  `jsonwebtoken`: this is the only JWT in the package, the format is a dozen
  lines of it, and `jsonwebtoken` is not a runtime dependency anywhere in this
  repo. `plugin-kit` and `plugin-walmart` already reach for `node:crypto` the
  same way.

**The assertion has to be minted per refresh** — it lives an hour, so a client
that outlives it would otherwise send an expired one forever. The only hook that
runs per refresh is `refreshConfig.requestInterceptor`, which core 1.0.0 cannot
carry as an ordinary property: it `structuredClone`s the config that holds it and
throws `DataCloneError`
([`/docs/core-behaviour.md`](../../../docs/core-behaviour.md#refreshconfig-is-deep-copied-so-it-cannot-hold-a-function)).
`plugin-google-vertex-ai` defines the interceptor **non-enumerable**, which
sidesteps the clone without a change in core — `structuredClone` walks own
_enumerable_ keys only, so the copy comes out clean while
`baseConfig.requestInterceptor` stays readable, and the config stays safe to
`JSON.stringify` as a bonus.

`plugin-google` has the same option open for Address Validation, whose docs say
to "configure an API key or OAuth to make an authenticated API request" — the
OAuth option there meaning a token minted for a Cloud project's service account.
It ships the API-key path instead, because that is the one a host can supply with
no user in the loop; adding the service-account path would mean minting tokens in
a `requestOptions.requestInterceptor` the way `plugin-usps` mints its payment
token, which is separate work.

## OpenID Connect userinfo

<https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect>
· <https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/reference>

Only `sub` is guaranteed on the response. Every other claim depends on the scopes
the user granted — `email`/`email_verified` need `email`; `name`, `given_name`,
`family_name`, `picture` and `locale` need `profile`; `hd` appears only for
accounts in a Google Workspace or Cloud organization. A granted scope is not a
guarantee either: Google warns that "users or their organizations may choose to
supply or withhold certain fields".

**`sub` is a string, and must stay one.** It is a 21-digit decimal, which is past
the range a JS number represents exactly. Anything keyed by a Google account id
— `getGoogleProfile`'s `userId`, which is the grant id — is a string for the same
reason.

**The Google+ era fields are gone.** This response type used to declare `id`,
`link` and `gender`; all three were removed when the Google+ API shut down and no
current endpoint returns them. `sub` is the replacement for `id`.

**The host is a legacy alias, unverified.** `getGoogleProfile` calls
`/oauth2/v3/userinfo` through the account's `baseUrl`, i.e.
`www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`. Google's current reference and its
discovery document name only `openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo`. The
alias still _appears_ to be served, but that could not be confirmed without a
live authenticated call — so this is inferred, not documented, and moving to the
documented host is left as a deliberate separate change.

## OpenID Connect userinfo has no published quota

`plugin-google`'s account client meters at **600 requests/minute**. That figure
is a self-imposed backstop and **not a vendor figure**: Google publishes no QPM
for the userinfo endpoint, and the one OAuth limit it does document — the
new-user authorization rate — is given as "dependent on application history,
developer reputation, and riskiness" with no number attached, so there is nothing
to encode. 600/min sits far above any sign-in-driven workload while still
bounding a runaway loop. Replace it if Google ever publishes a real number; do
not read it as one.

## Address Validation quotas

"There's a maximum request limit of 6,000 queries per minute for the validation
methods and another 6,000 QPM limit for feedback methods".

<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/usage-and-billing>
· <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/faq>

**What the quote settles: the split is by method _group_.** Validation methods
share one 6,000 QPM allowance and feedback methods have a separate one of the
same size — not one budget per method, and not one per region. This plugin calls
only a validation method, so a single 6,000 QPM bucket is the right _shape_, and
the feedback methods would need their own bucket if they were ever added.

**Open question: what the quota is scoped to.** The scope the bucket should be
keyed on — per Cloud project, per API key, or per billing account — is _not_
stated in either page above. "Metered per project" is the reasonable reading, by
analogy with Discovery Engine and Maps, both of which say "per project"
explicitly; but for Address Validation it is **inferred, not documented**, and it
has not been confirmed against a console Quotas page or a support answer.

This matters because the plugin buckets per _registered account_: one
`registerClientTemplate` call, one 6,000 QPM budget. If the real scope is the
Cloud project, then two accounts registered against one project each meter to
6,000 and can overrun it together — the same trap written up under
[Vertex AI Search](#vertex-ai-search-discovery-engine-quotas), where the
per-project scope _is_ documented. Resolving it needs the Quotas page for
Address Validation on a live project, read against two keys in one project.

## Google Maps Platform quotas

Nothing in this repo meters against these figures today. Kept because the shape
of the problem recurs whenever one client spans several Google APIs, and because
re-deriving it cost real time:

"The geocoding service is rate limited to 3,000 QPM (queries per minute),
calculated as the sum of client-side and server-side queries."

<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing>

**Quotas are held per project but configured per API** — the console's Quotas
page has you pick the API before editing a value — so a single client covering
every method under `/maps/api` spans several independent budgets rather than one.
Metering the lot at the tightest figure is the only single-bucket shape that
cannot overrun any of them.

Two traps worth carrying forward: the 6,000/min this replaced was double the
documented figure, and Google also enforces a per-second rate, so a burst can 429
below the per-minute ceiling.

## API-key injection

`plugin-google`'s Address Validation sub-client carries its API key in the query
string, and assigns it onto `config.params` rather than concatenating `?key=…`
onto `config.url` — verified on the wire, the key arrives exactly once. Four
failure modes of the string-concatenation version:

1. **`key=K&key=K` on the first retry.** Core re-runs a request interceptor on
   every attempt, against the config it already mutated — so one transient 500
   is enough. This is the non-local one, and the reason the code carries a note.
2. **A duplicate key** where the caller already supplied a `?key=`.
3. **The key inside a URL fragment**, if the url carries a `#`.
4. **A literal `key=undefined`** where the credential is absent, which reaches
   Google as a request with a malformed key rather than none.

Assigning on the params object is idempotent and immune to all four.

Where the key is used, the inherited OAuth block must also be cleared
(`authentication: undefined`). Leaving it in place has every call refresh a token
it does not send.
